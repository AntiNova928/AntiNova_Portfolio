## [Project 1 - Simple SQL Query Project Overview:](https://github.com/AntiNova928/PortfolioProjects.git)
### Created a simple SQL query based on YouTube trending videos from 2017-2018
* Wanted to know if there are any correlation between the trending videos and the type of content being put out
* Created a simple data exploration tool in SQL to explore on how to break down the data and gain insightful knowledge
* Optimized the dataset by creating CTE and CREATE TABLE to ensure that there are no repeated data
